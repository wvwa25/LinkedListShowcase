# LinkedListShowcase
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project demonstrates how simple-linked and double-linked lists work with a simple UI.
(If you aren't familiar, a linked list is a data structure which contains data points called "nodes" that connect together in a specified order. A simple-linked list is a list in which the nodes are connected in one direction and a double-linked list is a list in which the nodes are connected in both directions.)

I first created an abstract class *LinkedList* which is inherited by *SimpleLinkedList* and *DoubleLinkedList*.
This *LinkedList* class removes the commonalities from the other two, which have a fair bit of overlap.
Depending on which of the two list types is used, a *LinkedList* list variable is instantiated as either a SimpleLinkedList or DoubleLinkedList object.
Although both linked list classes can do all of the same things, the code for both is necessarily unique.

DIRECTIONS:
1. Open all .java source files in your IDE
2. Run the Main class in your IDE
